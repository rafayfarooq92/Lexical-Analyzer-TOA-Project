This is the Documentation of Lexical Analyser and Compiler Construction Code.
This is a very basic compiler which ensures tokenization and check basic syntax of the
Code.
The Construction is Divided into Two Parts
i) Lexical Analyzer
ii) Syntax Analyzer or Parser
How to use the Code:-
i)In order to check any program syntax you must have to first write it on the file named
as "PutYourCode.txt". 
ii)After putting your code save it and run the .exe of two codes i.e "Code Conversion" and
"Lexical Analyzer".
iii)The Lexical Analyzer took your code make and convert it to tokens. Check the "Token.txt"
file to check the tokens of your code.
iv) Next run the .exe of Syntax Checker. It will tell you the error if any on three parts
	a)Libraries which are included are correct
	b)Using namespace std is correctly written
	c)main is propely included
	d)Paranthesis are matched
